                  <h3>1.Guru basadi</h3>
                  <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
                    Guru Basadi is the earliest of the Jain monuments built in c. 714 CE.[1] A black stone idol of Parshwanatha, about 3.5 metres (11 ft) tall, is installed in the sanctum of this basadi.[2] According to Jain legend, a Jain monk from the 8th century was noticed a cow and a tiger drinking water from the same spot, tiger feeding the calf and cow feeding the tiger cubs while roaming a thick forest. Observing this miracle, the monk got the place excavated and idol of Parshvanatha was found in the area and a temple was consecrated here.[3]
An inscription dated back to 1307 CE inside Tirthankar Basadi mentions Guru Basadi receiving grants. The manastambha inside the temple was erected in 1615 CE.[4] The temple also houses the rare Jain palm leaf manuscripts of 12th century CE known as ‘Dhavala texts’ are preserved.[5] These texts were brought from shravanabelagola to here during Mughal invasion. This basadi is also called Siddantha Basadi and Hale Basadi\The Guru Basadi is almost as large as the famous Saavira Kambada Basadi located near the Guru Basadi. The temple is a rectangular structure with three mandapa leading to garbhagriha that houses an 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) idol of Parshvanatha as the moolnayak of the temple. The outer hall is supported by beautifully carved pillars.[8] The temple entrance has finely carved columns that supports a sloped roof. The temple houses a manasthambha in front of the temple entrance.[9] This temple houses miniature idols of many Jain Tirthankars

                  <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
                    
This Basadi is to the north of Moodbidri and hence it is called Badaga Basadi. This Basadi is 4-5 centuries old and is very beautiful. The Moolanayaka is the three-foot high marble idol of Chandranatha Swamy in Khadgasana pose. The Basadi faces east. In front of it stands the small maanastambha, shining like a nose-stud of an auspicious woman. 40 foot-high Manasthambha. Recently in 2010 a new flagstaff with copper plating was put up under the guidance of His Holiness Shri Swamiji with the help of donors. Car festival is held here every year with pomp and splendor on the 13th of Magha Shukla, after flag-hoisting on the 10th. It is a rare pacha Parshwanatha idol here. Good religious activities are conducted here with the participation of the Jain Shravakas of Belvai and locals and the devotees of Shree Mutt. The seat and halo of the Moolanayaka are of bronze and shine with a coating of diamond. The green stone idol of Parshwanatha Swamy in Khadgasana pose is invaluable and enthralling. Another specialty of this Jina Mandir is that it houses the bronze idols of the 24 Theerthankaras of the past, present and future.

               <h3>4. Hire Basadi or Ammanavara Basadi</h3> 
                <p class="" style="text-align:justify ;">
                  Bhagavan Shantinatha Swamy is the Moolanayaka of this Jain Mandir. It is famous as Ammanavara Basadi. It is called Hire Basadi because it is one of the oldest Basadis. The black stone idol is three foot high in Khadgasana pose. The earthen idols of the 24 Theerthankaras and the 6-feet high Goddess Saraswathi and Padmavati on either sides of the Basadi are captivating and worth seeing. The Devis receive special pooja on the Fridays in the month of Shravana each year. The car festival is held on the 6th of Falguna Shukla. Recently in 2002, the earthen idols of the Teerthankaras, Saraswati and Padmavati were renovated. 
                  Each of the Theerthankaras has got the original color set out by the Shastras. It is said a Shravaka by name Deepanna Shetty got these idols prepared. There is a stone edict here but the letters have faded and are illegible. There is an edict on the stone on the north of the Namaskara Mantap which says the renovation of the same Mantap was done by Uttameya Shantakantana Shetty in 1936. In this Basadi, a poet named Nemanna or Nemivrathi composed two Kannada poetic works titled Jnana Bhaskara Charithre and Suvichara Charithe around A. D. 1560. The famous poet Ratnakara Varni who lived about the same period had composed the epic poem Bharathesha Vaibhava, and also Triloka Shataka, Aparajitheshwara Shataka and Ratnakara Shataka.

The members of the Chowter Palace and other concerned Shravakas undertook a complete and comprehensive renovation with pachakalyana in 2002 under the guidance of H. H. Sri Sri Swamiji of the Jain Mutt.

            <h3>8.Kallu Basadi</h3>
            <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
                
              If time allows, then tourists are recommended to visit the Kallu Basadi that is otherwise known as Dodda Basadi.
               This basadi was constructed using rocks and that is why the site was named Kallu Basadi. The existence of a palatial courtyard is the reason why the site was also called Dodda Basadi (Big Basadi).
                Upon reaching the Kallu Basadi, travellers will get a chance to explore the 5-feet statue of Shantinatha. Tourists can also see rock formations of Yakshi Mahamanasi and Yasha Garuda on both sides of the idol.
                 The main attraction of Kallu Basadi is the Tirthankara idol that can be seen in Padmasana with a meditation stance. The idols of two Tirthankaras, namely Chandranatha and Mahaveera, are also kept inside the Kallu Basadi. On close observation, visitors can see an inscription on the base of the pedestal of the 24 bronze idols of Tirthankaras. This pedestal has been given the name Hari Peeta. Slate rock has been used for constructing the entrance (only the exterior part) of the Kallu Basadi. Travellers can also see the Saraswati idol (right side) and the Padmavathi Devi idol (left side) inside the sanctum sanctorum. Due to the presence of the above mentioned idols, the site is known as Ammanavara Basadi.Kallu Basadi, also known as the Black Basadi, is a historic Jain temple in Moodbidri. Constructed from black stone, the temple showcases remarkable craftsmanship and houses ancient Jain idols.

          <h3>9.Leppada Basadi</h3>
          <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
            Bhagavan Shantinatha Swamy is the Moolanayaka of this Jain Mandir. It is famous as Ammanavara Basadi. It is called Hire Basadi because it is one of the oldest Basadis. The black stone idol is three foot high in Khadgasana pose. The earthen idols of the 24 Theerthankaras and the 6-feet high Goddess Saraswathi and Padmavati on either sides of the Basadi are captivating and worth seeing. The Devis receive special pooja on the Fridays in the month of Shravana each year. The car festival is held on the 6th of Falguna Shukla. Recently in 2002, the earthen idols of the Teerthankaras, Saraswati and Padmavati were renovated. 
Each of the Theerthankaras has got the original color set out by the Shastras. It is said a Shravaka by name Deepanna Shetty got these idols prepared. There is a stone edict here but the letters have faded and are illegible. There is an edict on the stone on the north of the Namaskara Mantap which says the renovation of the same Mantap was done by Uttameya Shantakantana Shetty in 1936. In this Basadi, a poet named Nemanna or Nemivrathi composed two Kannada poetic works titled Jnana Bhaskara Charithre and Suvichara Charithe around A. D. 1560. The famous poet Ratnakara Varni who lived about the same period had composed the epic poem Bharathesha Vaibhava, and also Triloka Shataka, Aparajitheshwara Shataka and Ratnakara Shataka.

          <h3>10.Deramma Setty Basadi</h3>
          <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
              
            This Basadi built by the Shravaka, Deramma Shetty, faces west. In this Basadi there are three Mantapas, a Sanctum Sanctorum, a Namaskara Mantapa, and a Gopura Mantapa. It is two-storeyed. The idols of Ratnatraya, Ara, Malli and Muni Suvratha are installed here. One specialty here is that there are white limestone idols of the 24 Theerthankaras on the Haripeetha in front of the Moolanayaka in the sanctum sanctorum.
Story has it that Deramma was a poor cook. He set out to seek donations to build a Basadi. People made fun of him, saying, “What has he got to build a Basadi with? If at all, he has got only a little rice flour.” Insulted by this, Deramma decided to build a Basadi with his own hard-earned money and worked out his wish. A few decades back, Pachappa Indra of the Kere Basadi performed Pancha Kalyana here under the aegis of H. H. Sri Sri Swamiji of Sri Jain Mutt. There is a novelty to this stone structure. In a rare model of Swamy Peetha, the idols of Aranatha, Mallinatha and Munisuvrata stand tall. Below them there are the 24 Teerthankaras on the Jinapeetha. They look beautiful at the time of abhisheka. On the upper story of the Basadi there is the idol of Mallinatha Swamy.

          <h3>11.Chola Setty Basadi</h3>
          <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
            This Jain Mandir was built by the Shravaka by name Chola Shetty. It is noteworthy that, of all the 180 Basadis in the D. K. District, this is the only Basadi where Bhagavan Padmaprabha Swamy is the Moolnayak.This is also built with stone. The black stone idol of Bhagavan Padmaprabha Swamy shines with a coating of diamond. The idol is seated in a palanquin and is very attractive with a halo of bronze. Another specialty is that, though Padmavati is not the Yakshi of Bhagavan Padmaprabha Swamy, she has her idol here.
This is a stone-built grand structure. The 3.5 feet high idols of Sumathinatha, Padmaprabha and Suparshwanatha showing the meditation sign (Dhyana Mudra) and seated in Palyanka Asana are the Moolnayaks. The beauty of the diamond coating on the idols, their fixed gaze on the tip of their nose and their Dhyana Mudra cannot be seen anywhere else. The distinction of the Chola Shetty Basadi is that it has two small Basadis on its left and right. There is an idol of Neminatha seated on the conch, and it is famous as a very rare specimen of sculpture. Recently the Dharmothana Trust of Dharmastala undertook the renovation work of this Basadi as wished by H. H. Sri Sri Swamiji of the Jain Mutt.
Bhagavan Padmaprabha shines in the sanctum sanctorum. In the Teerthankara Mantap outside, the idols of Sumathi and Suparshwanatha sit facing east, leaning on the stone wall. All the three idols are seated in Palyanka Asana.

          <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
              
            Mahadev Shetty Basadi or Madi Basadi gets its name from the builder Mahadev Shetty. This beautifully built basadi houses the statue of presiding deity Shri Adinatha Tirthankara. This statue carved in black stone is five feet tall and is in the standing position. The metallic disk arching over this statue is an interesting feature. There are small cut idols of the Jain Tirthankaras on this arch. The work is intricately designed.
Jain Basadis are always a feast to the eyes. Be it the temple architecture or the idols that house within the basadi. A visit to these basadi is worth the effort.

          <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
            This Basadi, called Benki Basadi in common parlance, was built by the Shravaka, Baikanathi Athikari, a devotee of Shree Jain Mutt. Edicts say that he built the Basadi with the help of local people on a plot of land devoutly donated to Shri Jain Mutt by Dombarasa of Vittla through the Chowters of Moodbidri. In the sanctum sanctorum the three-foot black stone idol of Bhagavan Sri Ananthanatha Swamy in Kayotsarga pose shines forth enticingly as the Moolnayak. The idols of the 24 Theerthankaras are carved in the halo. There is a rare crystal Siddha idol here. In the forecourt of the Basadi there is a minuscule limestone shrine of Saraswathi holding Vina in her hands, built at the instance of the erstwhile Head of the Jain Mutt. Sharada Puja takes place here on the ten days of Dasara. Recently the idols of Kshetrapala and Saraswathi have been installed here.

          <h3>15.padu Basadi</h3>
          <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
            It is known from copper edicts and stone edicts that this Basadi is the most ancient, older than even Guru Basadi. As it is on the west of Moodbidri, it is called Padu(meaning West) Basadi. This Basadi is a grand stone structure. In the three sanctum sanctorum of this Basadi the idols of Ratnathraya, Bhagavan Vimala, Anantha and Dharmanatha Theerthankara are installed and worshipped. The idol of Anantha is older than the others. This can be learnt from the edict there. In the cavern on the upper story of the Basadi some 3000-4000 palm leaf manuscripts were kept safe. The late philanthropist Devakumarji  Ara learnt this from Shree Jain Mutt and did his services for its preservation. 
The Brahma Yaksha here is believed to be a great Karanika Devatha. Mahendra the poet has written a book in Kannada titled Gejje Brahma, eulogizing the glory of this Brahma Yaksha.

          <h3>16.Shri Jain Math Basadi</h3>
          <p class=" " style="text-align:justify ;">
            This Basadi is related to the Jain Mutt where the Head of the Mutt, Swastishri Charukeerthi Bhattaraka Pandithacharyavarya Maha Swamiji resides. Bhagavan Sri Parshwanatha Swamy is the Moolanayaka. The 13-inch idol is in standing posture. In the sanctum sanctorum of this holy shrine there are Panchaloha idols of the Theerthankaras, the crystal idols of Siddhas in Padmasana pose and various Jina idols in Khadgasana pose. The idols bathing in the light on the occasion of pujas radiate an exceptional spiritual bliss.
            The regnant Devi (Pattada Devi Yakshi) of Swastishri Charukeerthi Swamiji, Kushmandini Devi(Ambika), is worshipped along with Yakshi Padmavathi. Kushmandini Devi who resides in Nallur Basadi started to dwell and be worshipped in the Mutt of Moodbidri as well when the Mutt was set up. The Nallur Mutt and Basadi are under the management of the Moodbidri Swamiji. On his initiative many religious and cultural activities are going on there.
            In the old times the Swamiji of the Mutt had a vast hold of revenue land in the undivided Dakshin Kannada District. He was the second biggest land-holder in the district, and had a lot of tenants including Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others. Because of the Land Reforms Act, the Jain Mutt lost thousands of acres. Now the present Swamiji on his own initiation attracts devotees by thousands from all over India and abroad and runs non profitable charitable institutions, research centers and colleges. He plans and runs a string of religious, cultural, spiritual activities.

            This Basadi stands in the middle of Digambar Jain School in front of the Jain Mutt. Previously there was a Sanskrit School (Pathasale) here. There in a separate room a shrine for Muni Suvratha Swamy was carved and that is the Pathasale Basadi. The Moolnayak Muni Suvratha Swamy poses in a two-foot high cream-white lime-stone idol, in Khadgasana pose. This idol was given away to the Basadi and installed by the then Head of the Jain Mutt, one of the three founding fathers of Jain Vidyavardhaka Sangha, from the Siddhakoota of the Thousand Pillar Basadi. People suffering from the evil effect of Shani (the planet Saturn) offer Ksheerabhisheka Puja and Navagraha Shanti here.
