                    <h2>Jainism</h2>
                    <p class="justify"> Jainism also known as Jain Dharma, is an Indian religion. Jainism traces its
                        spiritual ideas and history through the succession of twenty-four tirthankars (supreme preachers
                        of Dharma), with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the tradition
                        holds to have lived millions of years ago, the twenty-third tirthankara Parshvanatha, whom
                        historians date to the 9th century BCE, and the twenty-fourth tirthankara Mahavira, around 600
                        BCE. Jainism is considered to be an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time
                        cycle of the cosmology. The three main pillars of Jainism are ahiṃsā (non-violence),
                        anekāntavāda (non-absolutism), and aparigraha (asceticism).
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 pt-2 pb-3">
                    <img src="assets/img/ashta.jpg" alt="#" class="img_height w-100" />
                </div>
                <p>Jain monks take five main vows: ahiṃsā (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing),
                    brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain
                    culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly lacto-vegetarian lifestyle.
                    Parasparopagraho jīvānām (the function of souls is to help one another) is the faith's motto, and
                    the Ṇavkar mantra is its most common and strongest prayer.</p>
                <h2>Jainism in Moodabidre</h2>
                <p>The Jains inhabited the region in and around Moodabidri as early as 3 centuries B.C. During this
                    period, a group of Monks led by Shrutha Kevali Bhadrabahu from northern India visited
                    Shravanabelagola. While fossils from before the 7th century A.D. aren't accessible, evidence from
                    ancient relics tied to Jain heritage scattered across various parts of the D.K. District supports
                    this assertion. The significant religious influence of Bhagawan Parshwanatha on this area is
                    evident. Historians suggest that Bhagavan Mahaveer's "SAMAVASARANA" (Dharmashala Mantapa) journeyed
                    through places like Kerala and Mysore (Hemanga) via Thulunadu. During Bhagavan Mahaveera's era, this
                    district earned the title "Sathyaputhras" (Blessed Sons).</p>
                <p>Around the 3rd-4th century B.C., Shruthakevali Bhadrabahu Muni, along with Mourya Chakravarthi
                    Chandragupta and 12,000 disciples, journeyed south and settled in Shravanabelagola. Some of his
                    disciples spread to Tamil Nadu, Telugu regions, Karnataka, and Thowlava, teaching and promoting
                    religious principles. Many of these Jains constructed Basadis, engaging in religious activities or
                    trade. A few ventured to islands, amassing great wealth and becoming prominent figures, while others
                    focused on studying ancient texts like Dwadashanga and delving into Vedas, literature, and religious
                    pursuits</p>
                <img src="assets/img/jimg1.jpg" alt="#" class="img_height w-100 pb-3" />
                <p>Those who performed daily rituals, worship, and poojas in Basadis, adhering to set principles under
                    religious leadership, were referred to as priests or purohits. (Such Jains carrying out daily
                    Archana, Pooja, and worship with reverence, including Abhishekha to Jineshwara, were known as
                    'Indras' in the undivided South Kanara district.)
                    <br>
                    Challenging times led to a decline in the Jain population in Moodabidri, previously known for its
                    prosperity. Consequently, Jain temples fell into disrepair, and thick bamboo jungles grew unchecked.
                    By the beginning of the 8th century, a monk from Shravanabelagola stumbled upon the area. While
                    searching for a place to relieve himself, he witnessed an unusual sight in a corner where Guru
                    Basadi now stands: a cow and a tiger affectionately grooming each other and sharing water from the
                    same bowl. This extraordinary interaction between natural enemies led the monk to believe the place
                    held a unique sanctity. Clearing the dense bamboo, the monk discovered an 11-foot-tall, captivating
                    statue of Sri Bhagawan Sri Parshwanatha Swamy, crafted from black stone and standing tall. The
                    statue, dating back a thousand years, prompted the construction of a splendid new Basadi to house
                    it, as guided by the monk.
                    <br>
                    Installed by the aforementioned monk known as "Shramana Guru," the Basadi earned the name "Guru
                    Basadi." Subsequently, numerous Jain Shravakas were initiated according to religious rituals and
                    sent across the state to propagate these principles, emphasizing nonviolence for societal and
                    national peace.
                    <br>
                    "Guru Basadi," also referred to as "Siddhantha Basadi," houses preserved ancient religious texts
                    like "Moolaagama" and "Parama Moolaagama," known as 'DHAVALAS,' printed in old Kannada. Moreover,
                    devotees can behold ancient statues, as old as 1000 years, carved meticulously from precious
                    gemstones. The revered statues were presented to this Basadi for safekeeping by order of the
                    religious leader. These treasures stand as unique instances of pen-written texts, distinct from the
                    needle-inscribed and inked method employed in North India. Among thousands of discovered religious
                    volumes, only these three Dhawalas are documented in this style.
